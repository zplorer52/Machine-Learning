# Regression with Scikit-learn datasets
## Instructions
---
Take a look at the Linnerud dataset in Scikit-learn. This dataset has multiple targets: 'It consists of three exercise (data) and three physiological (target) 
variables collected from twenty middle-aged men in a fitness club'.

In your own words, describe how to create a Regression model that would plot the relationship between the waistline and how many situps are accomplished. 
Do the same for the other datapoints in this dataset.
